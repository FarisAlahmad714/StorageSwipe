# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY FIX FOR EAS BUILD FAILURES

The issue is that your project has a `/ios` folder (indicating it's been ejected/prebuild), but EAS is failing during the Expo Configure project phase.

## SOLUTION: Force EAS to Skip Expo Autolinking

Since you have native iOS files, you need to tell EAS to use them directly instead of trying to configure them.

## Option 1: Add expo-build-properties (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Install the plugin
npm install expo-build-properties

# Clear everything and rebuild
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install
```

Then add to app.json:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "ios": {
            "deploymentTarget": "15.1"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

## Option 2: Create a Custom EAS Build Hook

Create `.eas/build/pre-install.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Skipping Expo autolinking..."
export EXPO_USE_COMMUNITY_AUTOLINKING=1
```

## Option 3: Use Bare Workflow Build Commands

Update eas.json:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Release",
        "scheme": "StorageSwipeApp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Option 4: Last Resort - Clear Native Files

If nothing else works:
```bash
# Remove iOS folder
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force ios

# Rebuild with expo prebuild
npx expo prebuild --clean

# Then build
npx eas-cli@latest build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
```

## The Real Issue

Your project is in a hybrid state - it has native iOS files but EAS is trying to treat it as a managed workflow. The "[Expo] Configure project" script is failing because it's trying to modify already-modified native files.

## Immediate Fix to Try:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
```

The `--clear-cache` flag forces EAS to start fresh.

Good luck! ðŸ¤ž
